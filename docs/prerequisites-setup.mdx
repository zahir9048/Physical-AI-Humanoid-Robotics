# Prerequisites and Development Environment Setup

To ensure a smooth learning and development experience with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook, it is essential to set up your development environment correctly. This section outlines the necessary prerequisites and provides guidance on configuring your system.

## Hardware Requirements (Refer to `hardware-requirements.mdx`)

Before proceeding, ensure your workstation meets the recommended specifications for your chosen tier (Digital Twin Workstation, Physical AI Edge Kit, or Robot Lab).

## Operating System

- **Recommended:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) or newer.
    - **Why:** ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac SDK, and many robotics development tools are primarily developed and tested on Ubuntu. It offers the best compatibility and community support.
- **Alternatives (with potential complexities):**
    - **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2):** A viable option for Windows users to run a Linux environment. May require additional configuration for GPU passthrough and hardware interaction.
    - **Other Linux Distributions:** While possible, may require manual dependency resolution and configuration, which is beyond the scope of this setup guide.

## Software Prerequisites

### 1. Git
- **Description:** Version control system for managing code and collaborating on projects.
- **Installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    ```
- **Configuration:**
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
    ```

### 2. Python 3
- **Description:** The primary programming language for ROS 2, AI/ML frameworks, and many robotics applications.
- **Installation:** Ubuntu 22.04 comes with Python 3 pre-installed. Verify with:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
- **Recommended:** Use `venv` or `conda` for isolated project environments.

### 3. Node.js & npm (for Docusaurus)
- **Description:** JavaScript runtime and package manager, required for building and serving the Docusaurus-based textbook.
- **Installation (Node.js 18.x or newer):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install curl
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt install -y nodejs
    ```
- **Verify:**
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

### 4. ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- **Description:** A flexible framework for writing robot software, essential for communication, hardware abstraction, and tool ecosystems.
- **Installation:** Follow the official ROS 2 Humble/Iron/Jazzy installation guide for Ubuntu. Key steps include:
    - Setting up locales.
    - Adding the ROS 2 apt repository.
    - Installing `ros-{distro}-desktop` (e.g., `ros-humble-desktop`).
    - Sourcing the setup file.

### 5. NVIDIA JetPack SDK (for Jetson-based kits)
- **Description:** A comprehensive software stack for NVIDIA Jetson platforms, including Linux for Tegra (L4T), CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT, and more.
- **Installation:** Flash your Jetson device with the latest JetPack version using NVIDIA SDK Manager.

### 6. Docker & Docker Compose
- **Description:** Containerization platforms often used for reproducible development environments, especially in robotics and AI.
- **Installation:** Follow the official Docker documentation for Ubuntu.
- **Post-installation steps:** Add your user to the `docker` group:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker
    ```

## Development Environment Setup

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Recommended IDE:** Install VS Code for a powerful and extensible development environment.
- **Key Extensions:**
    - **Python:** For Python language support, linting, and debugging.
    - **ESLint & Prettier:** For code quality and formatting.
    - **ROS:** For ROS 2 development with syntax highlighting and tools.
    - **Remote - SSH (for edge kits/robot labs):** For seamless development on remote machines.
    - **Markdown All in One:** For enhanced Markdown/MDX editing.

### Git Repository Cloning

Clone the textbook repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd physical-ai-textbook
```

### Docusaurus Project Initialization

After cloning, navigate to the project root and install Docusaurus dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the textbook in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
