# Why Physical AI Matters

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from purely digital intelligence to embodied intelligence, where AI systems interact with the real world through physical bodies, such as humanoid robots.

## The Transition to Embodied Intelligence

Traditional AI has excelled in virtual environments, but the challenges of real-world interaction, with its unpredictable dynamics and complex sensorimotor loops, require a new approach. Embodied AI grounds intelligence in physical experience, enabling robots to learn and adapt in ways that purely software-based AI cannot.

## Humanoid Robots: The Ultimate Embodiment

Humanoid robots, with their human-like form and capabilities, serve as ideal platforms for Physical AI research and application. They can navigate and manipulate in human-centric environments, making them suitable for a wide range of tasks from assistance to exploration.

## Training Data and Significance of Physical Form

Training Physical AI often involves real-world interaction and simulation. The physical form of the robot is not merely a vessel; it significantly influences how the AI perceives, learns, and interacts with its environment. Understanding biomechanics, sensory integration, and motor control is crucial.
