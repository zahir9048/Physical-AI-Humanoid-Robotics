# Module 5: Humanoid Robot Development

## Week 11: Kinematics, Dynamics, and Motion Planning

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of forward and inverse kinematics for humanoid robots.
- Analyze the dynamics of humanoid robot motion, including gravity compensation and joint torques.
- Implement basic motion planning algorithms for humanoid robot arms and legs.

### Content:
- **Kinematics:**
    - Forward kinematics: mapping joint angles to end-effector poses.
    - Inverse kinematics: computing joint angles for desired end-effector poses.
    - Jacobian matrix and its role in velocity and force analysis.
- **Dynamics:**
    - Lagrangian and Newton-Euler formulations for robot dynamics.
    - Mass matrix, Coriolis and centrifugal forces, and gravity vectors.
    - Impedance and admittance control for compliant interaction.
- **Motion Planning:**
    - Configuration space (C-space) and workspace.
    - Sampling-based planners (e.g., RRT, PRM) for high-dimensional humanoid robots.
    - Trajectory optimization techniques for smooth and efficient movements.
