# Module 5: Humanoid Robot Development

## Week 12: Bipedal Locomotion, Grasping, and Human-Robot Interaction

### Learning Objectives:
- Implement stable bipedal locomotion strategies for humanoid robots.
- Develop grasping and manipulation capabilities for interacting with objects.
- Explore principles of safe and effective human-robot interaction (HRI).

### Content:
- **Bipedal Locomotion:**
    - Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and Capture Point (CP) for stable walking.
    - Gait generation and balance control algorithms.
    - Whole-body control for coordinated movement of limbs and torso.
- **Grasping and Manipulation:**
    - Grasp synthesis: determining optimal grasp configurations for various objects.
    - Force control and tactile sensing for robust manipulation.
    - Dexterous manipulation with multi-fingered hands.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):**
    - Safety considerations in HRI: collision detection and avoidance.
    - Communication methods: gesture recognition, speech interfaces, emotional cues.
    - Collaborative robotics: shared autonomy and task allocation between humans and robots.
