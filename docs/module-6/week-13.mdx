# Module 6: Conversational Robotics and Capstone Project

## Week 13: Conversational Robotics

### Learning Objectives:
- Integrate large language models (LLMs) and speech recognition into robotic systems.
- Understand natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) in the context of human-robot interaction.
- Develop multi-modal interaction strategies for conversational robots.

### Content:
- **Speech Recognition and Synthesis:**
    - Introduction to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for converting speech to text.
    - Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems for generating natural-sounding robot voices.
    - Integrating open-source (e.g., Vosk, Whisper) and cloud-based (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Polly) services.
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**
    - Techniques for intent recognition, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis.
    - Using pre-trained LLMs (e.g., GPT, BERT) for conversational AI in robotics.
    - Fine-tuning LLMs for specific robot domains and tasks.
- **Multi-modal Interaction:**
    - Combining verbal communication with gestures, facial expressions, and visual cues.
    - Contextual understanding across different modalities.
    - Dialogue management and response generation for natural conversations.
